            <li>half a cup of dried cranberries, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>half a cup of hazelnuts, roughly chopped</li>

    <h2 class="two">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="one">
            <li>using a box grater, shave brussels sprouts into a large bowl. 
                use the natural end of the sprouts to hold against the grater, 
                don't worry about grating down past the end.</li>
            <li>add in the roughly chopped nuts and cranberries, 
                mix roughly with clean hands or a large salad spoon.</li>
            <li>using a zester, zest the half of a lemon.</li>
            <li>using a juicer, juice the half of a lemon into the bowl, 
                being careful not to get any seeds in.</li>
            <li>add olive oil to the bowl, mix together again.</li>
            <li>add salt and pepper to taste, small amounts at a time until 
                seasoned to your liking. mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>plate the salad, top with freshly shaved parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4 class="three">Notes</h4>
        <ul class="four">
            <li>experiment with different types of nuts, 
                e.g. pine nuts, pistachios, etc.</li>
            <li>similarly, try different citruses in place of the lemon</li>
            <li>to keep recipe vegan, substitute parmesan for nutritional yeast</li>
        </ul>
