    <h2 class="two">Description</h2>
        <p class="one">A very vegetable forward shepherd's pie, 
            sauce for the filling made from scratch.</p>
        <p class="one">There are a few components to build this dish, you will be multitasking.</p>
    <h2 class="two">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="one">
            <li>three large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>12 to 16 oz bag of frozen mixed vegetables</li>
            <li>two impossible burger patties</li>
            <li>two  heaping tablespoons of vegan butter, separated</li>
            <li>roughly a quarter of a cup of flour (you may use less or more)</li>
            <li>one pint of vegan fake chicken stock</li>
            <li>one large onion, diced</li>
            <li>two tablespoons of unsweetened almond milk</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>tablespoon of oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 class="two">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="one">
            <li>preheat oven to 400Â°F.</li>
            <li>peel and dice the potatoes into roughly one inch cubes, 
                place in a medium pot, and cover with water. Cook over high heat 
                until boiling, then simmer while working on the other components.</li>
            <li>while potatoes are cooking, put oil in a medium sautee pan on 
                medium high heat and brown/break up the impossible patties. When they are
                 fully browned, remove from pan and set aside in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>using the same sautee pan, cook the onion on medium low to medium
                 heat, until the oinion starts to turn transluscent. remove from 
                 the pan and place in the bowl with the impossible meat.</li>
            <li>in the same pan, heat up the frozen vegetables, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>you will now be making a gravy from scratch:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>in a separate medium sauce pan over medium heat,
                         melt one tablespoon of vegan butter.</li>
                    <li>once fully melted, begin incorporating the flour little 
                        by litle. as you add small amounts, constantly whisk it
                         into the butter. you are making a roux. when the small
                          amount you have added is fully incorporated, add another
                           small amount, until the roux resembles a loose dough,
                            and smells nutty. if you need to, you can turn 
                            the heat down during this step.</li>
                    <li>slowly add in the vegan broth, while still whisking 
                        constantly. if you turned the heat down in the
                         previous step, you can turn it up once the liquid 
                         starts to incorporate.</li>
                    <li>add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>if the gravy is too thin, let it cook a bit longer. 
                        too thick, add small amounts of water.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>add the gravy and frozen vegetables into the bowl, and mix 
                everything together.</li>
            <li>kill the heat on the potatoes, and drain the water. add the other 
                tablespoon of vegan butter and the almond milk to the potatoes, 
                mash to your desired consistency. add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>pour the gravied mixture into the bottom of a casserole dish, 
                smooth out, and top with the mashed potatoes.</li>
            <li>bake for 15-20 minutes, or as long as it takes for the potatoes 
                to start to brown.</li>
            <li>remove from oven, let cool slightly, and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4 class="three">Notes</h4>
        <ul class="four">
            <li>any vegetables can be used in place of or in addition to
                 the frozen vegetables</li>
            <li>vegetable stock can be subbed for the fake chicken stock</li>
            <li>impossible patties can be subbed out for your preferred vegan 
                protein, e.g. tempeh, seitan, a mushroom mix, etc.</li>
